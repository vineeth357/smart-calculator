# smart-calculator
Calculators are a very helpful tool that we all use on a regular basis. Why not create one ourself, and make it really special? 
In this project, I wrote a calculator that not only performs basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponential but also smart enough to remember variables and warn us if we gave incorrect expression for operation.

I implemented such a calculator in python using data structures like stacks, dictionaries, and performed string operations. And used try and except blocks to catch and handle exceptions.
